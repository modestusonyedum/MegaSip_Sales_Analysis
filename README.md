# Overview

Mega Sip Beverages is a growing beverage distribution company supplying popular brands such as Coke, Fanta, Sprite, and other leading soft drinks to major retailers including Costco, Walgreens, Target, and Walmart. As the organisation expanded, sales reporting became increasingly fragmented due to reliance on separate spreadsheets managed by regional managers. To address challenges related to data consolidation, reporting accuracy, and analytical capability, MegaSip implemented a Power BI solution using a centralised folder connection and automated refresh, enabling real-time visibility of performance across all locations.

## Problem Statement

The organization currently depends on Excel for compiling, analyzing, and reporting its monthly sales and transaction data. It has become increasingly cumbersome and time-consuming due to the complexity of the data and the high volume of transactions processed each month. The reporting process involves manual data entry and consolidation from multiple sources, which introduces errors and inconsistencies.

## Aim

This project aims to build a data model in Power BI using Deskify Office Supply Co.’s sales and transaction data. The solution will centralize data sources, streamline data cleaning, and reduce manual processes to improve reporting accuracy and efficiency.
Finally, interactive dashboards will be developed to support faster, data-driven decision-making.

## Datasource

The dataset used in this project was a simulated company dataset structured around a retail sector scenario. It reflects real-world data patterns and problem.

The data was cleaned and modeled into a star schema, ensuring it's optimized for performance and scalability in Power BI.

## Data Model
The data model uses a star schema with one fact table **(TransactionFact)** linked to five dimension tables for **customer, product, order, location, and calendar** data. One-to-many relationships with single-direction filtering ensure clear and efficient analysis. A dedicated Calculated Measures table centralizes DAX calculations for easier maintenance.

Overall, the model is clean, scalable, and optimized for Power BI reporting, with future improvements including hierarchies, surrogate keys, and expanded cost structures.

## Analytical Approach
The dashboard is structured into two key analytical layers, each designed to answer specific business questions within the company.


### 1. Customer Analytics

This section focuses on understanding customer behavior and profitability.
**Key Metrics**
- Total Revenue: **14.74M**
- Total Profit: **1.52M**
- Total Orders: **5496**
- Total Customers: **1795**
- Profit Margin: **10.33%**


**Analysis Performed**
- Which customer segments generated the highest profit?
- How does profit vary across different customer segments and regions?
- Which 5 customers are responsible for the largest purchases?
- Based on the subcategory, how do they each contribute to profitability?

**Key Insights**
- Profit is concentrated among a small group of high-value customers, including Emily Phan (34.01K), Deborah Brumfield (31.12K), and Grant Carroll (27.98K). If these customers cut back or stop buying, the impact on results could be significant.

- Subcategory insight reveals key performers such as binders, paper, and furnishings, while the copier category operates at a loss of -16K, suggesting pricing issues, warranty expense, or high logistics overhead.

- By segment, Corporate contributes the most profit at 527.1K, while Home Office, Consumer, and Small Business together make up a substantial share. This confirms that Deskify serves both B2B and B2C markets. Geographic performance is similarly uneven: the Northwest leads at 569,398, while Yukon and Quebec remain significantly underdeveloped.

- These patterns point to clear growth opportunities through targeted marketing, regional penetration strategies, and customer loyalty initiatives. Refining segmentation, reducing reliance on top contributors, and activating weaker markets would diversify revenue and strengthen long-term, customer-driven profitability.


### 2. Product Analytics
This section focuses on the product performance.


**Analysis Performed**
- What are the top 10 states based on Deskify's profitability?
- Which product categories contributed the most to profitability?
- How does the choice of shipping method impact the number of orders?
- Which 5 products are the most profitable for Deskify?
- How has *Deskify's* profit evolved over time?


![](Visuals/Product_Analysis.png)


**Key Insights**
- Deskify’s product performance shows strong revenue contribution from certain categories, with **Office Supplies** generating the majority of total profit at **985.36K (64.73%)**, followed by Furniture at **331.03K** and Technology at **205.95K**.

- Top individual products including **Eldon ClusterMat and Panasonic** models highlight a dependency on a small set of profitable SKUs, creating product concentration risk.

- Operational data further indicates significant shipping cost pressure due to reliance on **air freight (nearly 90% of orders)**, which likely diminishes margins and limits scale efficiency.

- Seasonal trends reveal noticeable fluctuations in monthly performance, with **October (177K) and January (174K)** as the highest-earning months, and **August (81K)** the weakest. These fluctuations likely correlate with procurement cycles, budgeting periods, and business purchasing behaviors rather than consumer-driven trends. 


**Recommendation**

Overall, strengthening the product portfolio through cost optimization, renegotiated vendor terms, improved shipping strategy, and a focus on high-margin categories represents a key opportunity to unlock higher profitability.
